This is done by using information from the word co-occurance matrix to optimize the word vectors. Basically, the X(i,j) entry of the co-occurance matrix says how frequent word i to appear near j. We also use a weighting mechanishm to give more weight to words close together than to ones further-apart (from experiments section of the paper)."
